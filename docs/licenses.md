# Licenses

## What is a license?

An AI model is a copyrightable work. So by default, the author has full rights over the models they create. This means that no one, except the author, can legally use, share, or modify the model without explicit permission from the author (contract). This is a problem if the author wants to make the model publicly available, and a license is the solution.

A license is a legal document that grants certain permissions to everyone. So you do not have to ask the author for permission, saving both you and the author the trouble. Which permissions are granted is decided by the author. Different licenses grant different permissions under different conditions. OpenModelDB shows a brief summary of the key points of the license, so you can easily the most important permissions and conditions.

Note that **all licensed models** on OpenModelDB allow private use. So you can use the model to upscale any image you like, and then do with the upscale image whatever you like. You do not need to ask anyone for permission.

## Upscaled images

It is important to note that the license of a model does **not** extend to the upscaled images produced by the model. For example, a model under a non-commercial license can be used to upscale images that are then used commercially.

In general, the license of the upscaled images is determined by the license of the original images, not the model. E.g. if a person X holds the copyright to the original image, then person X will also hold the copyright to any upscaled images of the original.

While there may be custom model licenses with additional terms for upscaled images, all commonly-used licenses do **not** include such terms.

## Picking a license

> _This section is intended for model authors that want to publish their models._

As a model author, you should strongly consider publishing your model under a permissive license. This will make it vastly easier for others to use your model.

If you don't have much time (or don't care about the legal stuff), here's the TLDR:

-   `CC0-1.0`: If you just want people to use your model, no strings attached, they don't even need to credit you.
-   `CC-BY-4.0`: If you want people to credit you, but they can do whatever they want with it (even make money off of it).
-   `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0`: If you want people to credit you and don't like the idea of people making money off of your work.

It should be noted that all license we recommend having the following properties:

1. Private use allowed. Anyone can freely use the model for non-commercial purposes.
2. Distribution allowed. Anyone can freely share the model. Although some conditions may apply (e.g. giving credit).
3. Liability & warranty. You are not liable for any damages caused by the model. The model is provided "as is", without any warranty.

There are many licenses to choose from, all granting different permissions under different conditions. We recommend using one of the following licenses:

-   `CC0-1.0` - [CC0 - Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en)

    Anyone is allowed to use your model for whatever they want. No restrictions, no conditions, no obligations.

    This is the most permissive license. If you just want your work to be out there, free for anyone to use, this is the license for you.

    -   Credit: Not required
    -   Commercial use: Allowed
    -   Modification: Allowed

-   `CC-BY-4.0` - [CC BY 4.0 - Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

    Anyone is allowed to use your model for whatever they want, as long as they give you credit.

    If you just want people to credit you and don't care about commercial use, this is the license for you.

    -   Credit: Required
    -   Commercial use: Allowed
    -   Modification: Allowed

-   `CC-BY-NC-4.0` - [CC BY-NC 4.0 - Attribution-NonCommercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)

    Anyone is allowed to use your model for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give you credit.

    -   Credit: Required
    -   Commercial use: Not allowed
    -   Modification: Allowed

-   `CC-BY-SA-4.0` - [CC BY-SA 4.0 - Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

    Anyone is allowed to use your model for whatever they want, as long as they give you credit. Additionally, anyone who modifies or builds upon your model must publish their modifications under the same license.

    -   Credit: Required
    -   Commercial use: Allowed
    -   Modification: Allowed, if published under the same license.

-   `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0` - [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

    Anyone is allowed to use your model for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give you credit. Additionally, anyone who modifies or builds upon your model must publish their modifications under the same license.

    This is a popular license for people who want to share their work, but do not want others to make money off of it. This license will ensure that your model (and all of its derivatives) will always be free.

    -   Credit: Required
    -   Commercial use: Not allowed
    -   Modification: Allowed, if published under the same license.
