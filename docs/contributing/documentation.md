# Documentation

The documentation of this site is generated from simple MarkDown files inside the repository of the site.
It's a [public repository](https://github.com/OpenModelDB/open-model-database), so anyone with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account can contribute by adding or changing documentation pages.
This page will tell you exactly how to do it.

If you want to learn or need a quick refresher on MarkDown syntax, [visit this site](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

If you don't know what MarkDown is, don't worry, you've likely used it before without knowing.
Many chatting and messaging apps use MarkDown (or MarkDown-like languages) to give users the ability to do basic formatting.
