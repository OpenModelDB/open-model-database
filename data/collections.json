RG0 means that the B channel is set to 0. These models will work not correctly if you give them images with non-zero B channel, so you either have to zero the B channel manually or use tool like chaiNNer to do it.\n\n## DDS Compression\n\nI made 3 versions: \n- Normal RG0 is for uncompressed normal map textures. Since it hasn't been trained on compression artifacts, it's highly sensitive to quantization artifacts and noise.\n- Normal RG0 BC1 is for BC1-compressed DDS normal map textures.\n- Normal RG0 BC7 is for BC7-compressed DDS normal map textures. This model sometimes produces images that aren't as sharp. In those cases, you can try the BC1 version to see whether it gives better results.",

        "description": "Collection of models for use in restoration and upscaling of the TV series \"Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?\" from the 1990s. While primarily consisting of cel-based animation, the show also incorporates live-action (including stock footage and scenes involving \"The Player\"), 3D CGI (primarily used for the C5 Corridor), and 2D computer animation. The models are divided into two groups:\n\n* Deinterlace Fix\n* Upscaling\n\nThe deinterlacing fox models are primarily designed for the 2012 Mill Creek release, where a number of episodes have some rather harsh forced deinterlacing, which the models attempt to repair. These models may also be useful for improving picture quality in some scenes (primarily in seasons 3 and 4) that used deinterlacing as part of compositing multiple layers of images, and for improving the results of deinterlacing by QTGMC or other processes.\n\nSpeaking of deinterlacing, for episodes in 480i, I recommend using QTGMC to deinterlace them to 60 (59.97) fps, the frame rate of the live-action and (some) C5 Corridor footage. For the pre-deinterlaced episodes, you're going to be stuck at 30 fps since the other-frame information has already been removed. Despite this series being primarily cel-based animation, I **don't** recommend using 24 fps as it tends to make higher-framerate portions look odd.\n\nThe upscaling models work pretty much how you would expect.\n\nEach model has a small and large variant. The large variants are based on the OmniSR architecture, and tend to produce better results (marginally so in the case of the deinterlacing fix), but are several times slower than the small models, which use the compact architecture.",
