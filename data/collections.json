        "description": "This collection contain my RG0 normal map upscaling models.\n\nAll models here are for upscaling *tangent-space* normal maps in RG0 format. RG0 means that the B channel is set to 0. These models will work not correctly if you give them images with non-zero B channel, so you either have to zero the B channel manually or use tool like chaiNNer to do it.\n\n## DDS Compression\n\nI made 3 versions: \n- Normal RG0 is for uncompressed normal map textures. Since it hasn't been trained on compression artifacts, it's highly sensitive to quantization artifacts and noise.\n- Normal RG0 BC1 is for BC1-compressed DDS normal map textures.\n- Normal RG0 BC7 is for BC7-compressed DDS normal map textures. This model sometimes produces images that aren't as sharp. In those cases, you can try the BC1 version to see whether it gives better results.",
