    "description": "Nice to release a model again! This one is intended for realistic imagery, and works especially well on faces, hair, and nature shots. It should only be used on somewhat clear shots, without a lot of grain. I trained this model on SPAN, which as of the time of release, you'll need chaiNNer-nightly for. I aimed for a softer, more natural look for this model with as few artifacts as possible.\n\nIn addition to the Normal model, I've included a \"soft\" model. The Soft model is... softer. Basically it was an earlier version of the model with a more limited dataset. It produces more natural output on games or rendered content, but suffers a bit more with realistic stuff.\n\nNote: In shots with DOF (depth of field) or bokeh, unfortunately there will be artifacts. \n\nCompatibility: You'll have to use the latest chaiNNer-nightly to use this model",
