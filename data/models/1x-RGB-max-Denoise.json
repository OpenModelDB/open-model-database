    "description": "A fast upscaler that is a replacement for standard methods of cleaning noise from the picture. Ideal for BDRemux or WEB-DL 720p or 1080p it. It gets rid of floral noise well, the smaller its grain size, the more uniform the resolution for all videos will be. If you need a more stable video, then you can also add 2x-DigitalFlim-SuperUltraCompact after this upscaler. My upscaler can slightly simplify the geometry of very small objects.",
