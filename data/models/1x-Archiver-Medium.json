    "description": "A general-purpose model from the Archivist suite, providing a balanced approach to removing common film grain and dirt while preserving the original drawing texture. It is the recommended starting point for most footage.\n\nThis model is optimized for input resolutions between 720p and 1080p. Using it on significantly different resolutions may produce suboptimal results.\n\nAll Archivist models are trained on a custom dataset generated by a physics-based degradation simulator. Recommended Workflow: Use Archivist to fix physical defects, then pass the result through DRUNet (low strength) to stabilize.",
