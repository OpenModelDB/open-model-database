    "description": "Category: Anime and Cartoon Restoration\nPurpose: Animation\n\nThis model corrects jagged lines on animation that has been deinterlaced. It handles simple line doubling, line interpolation, and even Yadif-style artifacts. It can also handle sources that were resized after deinterlacing, for example resizing from ntsc to pal resolutions. If a source has been upscaled after deinterlacing, it will need to be downsized before applying this model.",
