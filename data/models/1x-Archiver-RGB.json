    "description": "A specialized model from the Archivist suite, specifically tuned for tackling heavy chromatic (color) noise and severe color channel degradation, often seen in Metrocolor films. Note: its capabilities overlap with the Rough model, but it is better suited for color-based artifacts.\n\nThis model is optimized for input resolutions between 720p and 1080p. Using it on significantly different resolutions may produce suboptimal results.\n\nAll Archivist models are trained on a custom dataset generated by a physics-based degradation simulator. Recommended Workflow: Use Archivist to fix physical defects, then pass the result through DRUNet (low strength) to stabilize.",
