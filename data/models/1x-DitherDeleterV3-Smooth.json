    "description": "Attempts to remove the damages done by dithering. For this model, I downscaled all of the HR images to make their pixel size closer to 1000x1000 using the Box filter and then downscaled them again by 50% using the Point filter. Afterwards, I applied 32-bit Riemersma to every image in the dataset.",
