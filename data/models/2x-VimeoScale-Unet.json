The real-esrgan/BSRGAN augmentation and Unet should help with videos where the resolution is not ideal and can reconstruct details without effecting blurs in most cases. This model SHOULD run faster than real-esrgan while matching the resolving and enabling some multiframe feature extraction. No major denoising/compression/blurring effects (or artifacts) should be found.",
