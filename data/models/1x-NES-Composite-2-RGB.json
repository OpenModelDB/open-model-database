    "description": "Takes composite/RF/VHS NES footage and attempts to restore it to RGB quality. Assumes footage has been properly deinterlaced via field duplication from 240p to 480p/720p/etc. Note that:\n\n* All footage was captured in 240p/480p/720p NTSC.\n* RGB footage was captured via an AV Famicom with the RGB Blaster via the Retrotink 2x or GBS Control.\n* The model was trained exclusively on individual frames, so it can't fix things like dropouts.\n* The even and odd fields of NES composite tend to be a bit...different from each other, so there will be some jitter at 60fps.\n* I don't have access to an NES Toploader, so I wouldn't expect it to fix the jailbars very well.\n\nRevision History:\n\n* 1.5.0 (06/29/2025): Applied additional augmentations to reduce overfitting. Also added a small amount of 720p training data.\n* 1.0.0 (11/03/2024): Initial release.",
