    "description": "Category: Video Compression\nPurpose: artifact\n\nThis model attempts to make films upscaled to 4K with Topaz Gaia-HQ look more natural and filmic. It sharpens, adds film grain, and smooths out small artefacts from the upscaling process. I recommend adding a tiny amount of grain to the input to seed the model (you can do this in VEAI), otherwise the film grain will remain static across frames that don't move much.
