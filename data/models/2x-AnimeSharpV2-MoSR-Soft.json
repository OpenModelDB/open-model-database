    "description": "GitHub Link: https://github.com/Kim2091/Kim2091-Models/releases/tag/2x-AnimeSharpV2_Set\n\nThis is my first anime model in years. Hopefully you guys can find a good use-case for it. Included are 4 models:\n\n1. RealPLKSR (Higher quality, slower)\n2. MoSR (Lower quality, faster)\n\nThere are Sharp and Soft versions of both\nWhen to use each:\n- __Sharp:__ For heavily degraded sources. Sharp models have issues depth of field but are best at removing artifacts \n- __Soft:__ For cleaner sources. Soft models preserve depth of field but may not remove other artifacts as well\n\n__Notes:__\n- MoSR doesn't work in chaiNNer currently\n- To use MoSR:\n  1. Use the ONNX version in tools like [VideoJaNai](<https://github.com/the-database/VideoJaNai>)\n  2. Update spandrel in the latest version of ComfyUI\n\nThe ONNX version may produce slightly different results than the .pth version. If you have issues, try the .pth model.",
