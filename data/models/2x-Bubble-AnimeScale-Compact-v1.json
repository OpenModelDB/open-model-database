    "description": "Category: Anime and Cartoons\nPurpose: Anime or Text\nPretrained: 4x_muy4_035_1.pth\n\nThis is my first model, so it's not perfect, but I wanted to see if I could train an upscaling model that didn't result in a lot of detail loss and deblurring like the current Compact upscaling models. I believe I accomplished this, but I was unable to reduce contrast shifting. The contrast shifting may cause skin tones to appear incorrect on bright frames, but it's not too bad overall! I'll list a few examples below; more can be found by clicking the Overview link on the Github release page.",
