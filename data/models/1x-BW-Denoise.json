    "description": "A fast upscaler that is a replacement for standard methods of cleaning noise from the picture. Ideal for BDRemux 720p and 1080p, but only if the noise is monochrome or close to it. So far, attempts are underway to create a dataset that could eliminate color noise at the same speed.",
