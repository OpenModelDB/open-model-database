    "description": "This model is made for Source Engine textures. It tries to remove compression artifacts such as blockyness, discoloration, green tint. It does pretty well on a lot of things, realistic stuff as well, but it was mostly made to work on TF2 textures. It's made to keep as much detail as possible, without any unnecessary denoising/sharpening. Huge thanks to Twittman for assisting me along this journey.",
