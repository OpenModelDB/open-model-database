    "description": "Category: Video Compression\nPurpose: Compression\nPretrained: none\n\nThis model was trained on lossless video frames of Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, compressed with Bink V1 for the LR frames. It's a lot more efficient than my first DeBink model, and also has less artifacts. It's not quite as robust, but the compression is barely noticeable in videos after processing with this.",
