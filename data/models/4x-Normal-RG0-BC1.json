    "description": "A 4x upscaler for BC1-compressed normal maps with a zeroed-out B channel. The output normals will also have a constant-zero B channel. Use external software or image editing plugins to properly normalize the generated normals and generate the Z component (if necessary). E.g. chaiNNer can do this with Normalize Normal Map node. Do not rely on this network producing unit vectors. \n\n**Dataset transformation:** \\\nThe LR have been compressed with various BC1 compression settings (dithering, weighting) using Texconv version 2021.11.8.1. Since the contents of the B channel influence the R and G channels during compression, the LR were given a B channel that was either the Z component of the normal, a random constant color, or a random texture (usually the G channel of the associated albedo) before compression. The LR + B channel was then compressed and the resulting BC1-compressed DDS was converted back into a PNG and had its B channel zeroed out.\n\nMore information: https://github.com/RunDevelopment/ESRGAN-models/blob/main/normals/README.md",
