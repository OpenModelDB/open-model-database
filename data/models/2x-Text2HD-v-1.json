    "description": "Purpose: Upscale text in very low quality to normal quality.\n\nThe upscale model is specifically designed to enhance lower-quality text images, improving their clarity and readability by upscaling them by 2x. It excels at processing moderately sized text, effectively transforming it into high-quality, legible scans. However, the model may encounter challenges when dealing with very small text, as its performance is optimized for text of a certain minimum size. For best results, input images should contain text that is not excessively small.",
