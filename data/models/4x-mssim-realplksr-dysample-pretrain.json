So with the [commits from three days ago, the 24.06.24, on neosr](https://github.com/muslll/neosr/commits/master/?since=2024-06-24&until=2024-06-24), I wanted to create a 4x photo pretrain I can then use to train more realplksr models with dysample specifically to stabilize training at the beginning.\n\nShowcase:  \n[Imgsli](https://imgsli.com/Mjc0OTA1)  \n[Slowpics](https://slow.pics/c/I9grkcqM)",
