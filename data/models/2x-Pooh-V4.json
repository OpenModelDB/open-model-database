    "description": "Purpose: Compression Removal, Noise Reduction, Line Correction, MPEG2 / LD Artifact Removal\n\nThis is my first model release. The model was inspired from a personal project which I have been pursuing for some time now, which this model aims to solve. This model will upscale low resolution hand drawn animation from 1970s to 2000. The colors are retained with effective noise control. Details and Textures are maintained to a good degree considering animations. Color Spills are also corrected depending on the colors. Shades of white and yellows have been difficult. It also makes the lines slightly sharper and thinner. This could be a plus depending on your source. The model is also temporally stable across my tests with little observable issues. \n\n**Showcase:** \nImages - https://imgsli.com/MjYwNzY1/12/13\nVideo Sample -  https://t.ly/Jp7-w vs Upscale - https://t.ly/PdsKs",
