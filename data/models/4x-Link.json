    "description": "Category: Game Screenshots\nPurpose: Chainmail game textures. Alternatively, it can be used to turn plain images into chainmail.\nPretrained: 4x_Nickelfront_14000G.pth\n\nA highly generative model for chainmail game textures. Works fairly well on items without visible chainmail texture (ie just a grey area) or items with clear chainmail texture, less well on items with present but poorly defined chainmail texture. I'm not 100% happy with it but it is still an improvement over existing models in enough situations to be worth releasing.",
