    "description": "Category: DDS (BC1/DXT1, BC3/DXT5 Compression)\nPurpose: DXT1 Compression\n\nRemoving compression artifacts from DXT1 compressed textures. This model was created to remove DXT1 compression artifacts from textures imported into the Source Engine. Compressed textures in the engine sometimes have a green-tint which this model also corrects. The data for this model contained a good mix of diffuse textures and normal maps which means this model is pretty good at removing compression from normals as well. Creating this model was a real learning experience for me and I hope someone finds a good use for it.",
