    "description": "Takes composite/RF/RGB/VHS Genesis footage and attempts to restore it to RGB quality. Assumes footage has been properly deinterlaced via field duplication from 240p to 480p/720p/etc. Note that:\n\n* All footage was captured in 240p/480p/720p NTSC.\n* Ground truth RGB footage was captured via a triple-bypassed Model 2 Genesis with new capacitors via the Retrotink 2x or GBS Control. Other footage was captured from various Model 1 Genesis consoles (with and without the \"High Definition Graphics\" mark).\n* The model was trained exclusively on individual frames, so it can't fix things like dropouts.\n* Should help fix color, blur, and jailbars.\n* Cannot un-dither fully blended pixels.\n\nCompared to the OmniSR variant of this model, this version runs more quickly (despite the larger model file size), and should do a good job on footage captured directly from the console using composite or RGB. If your footage is from a VHS tape or was captured over RF, the slower OmniSR model is probably a better choice.\n\nRevision History:\n\n1.0.0 (09/16/2025): Initial release.",
