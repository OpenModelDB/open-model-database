    "description": "Category: Anime and Cartoons\nPurpose: Animation\n\nThis model is based on a private model by @eula 5600x 3070 named 4x_eula_anifilm_v1_225k. He sent me a copy of the model, and I decided to train a compact model based on it with his permission. This model seems to fix the majority of the issues the original model had while being far faster, it's just a tiny bit softer in some images.\n\nThe dataset consists of Dragon Ball movies converted to YUV24 with @sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda's help to reduce artifacts, then upscaled with ArtClarity and eula_anifilm. LRs are the original frames right from DVD. As a result, this model corrects some color space issues. The 2x model's HRs were downscaled by 50% with Lanczos.\n\nThe 2x and 4x models are pretty close in output despite being trained separately. The 2x model is a bit softer overall.\n\nThe models in the Real-ESRGAN Compatible folder are the original output from Real-ESRGANs training code for compatibility reasons.",
