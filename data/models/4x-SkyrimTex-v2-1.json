    "description": "Category: Video Game Textures\nPurpose: Game textures\n\nThis model set upscales most Skyrim textures. I hope it helps ðŸ™‚ The base model (2.1) works well on stone, wood, metals, and most other textures. The Fabric model is a 50/50 interpolation with a stronger iteration of this model and my Fabric model. As you can tell by the name, it's intended for Fabric textures. If you want to upscale Alpha textures, use a model dedicated to it. There's an INFO file in the folder, it just explains the extra models",
