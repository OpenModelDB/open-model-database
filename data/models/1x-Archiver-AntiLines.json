    "description": "A specialized model from the Archivist suite, designed to remove linear artifacts. It excels at eliminating horizontal lines that other denoisers often mistake for part of the line art.\n\nThis model is optimized for input resolutions between 720p and 1080p. Using it on significantly different resolutions may produce suboptimal results.\n\nAll Archivist models are trained on a custom dataset generated by a physics-based degradation simulator. Recommended Workflow: Use Archivist to fix physical defects, then pass the result through DRUNet (low strength) to stabilize.",
