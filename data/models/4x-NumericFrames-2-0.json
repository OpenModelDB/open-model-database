    "description": "Upscaling of Numeric Animation from SD to HD with high texture retention.\n\nA serious upgrade over 1.0. Much more universality. Can look good on both clean SD and noisy/grainy source frames. It still has a weakness against sources with strong halos and jagged edges and rainbowing. (Recommended that these issues are fixed beforehand with avisynth)",
