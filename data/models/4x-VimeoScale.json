    "description": "Category: Pretrained Discriminators\nPurpose: Upscaling IRL video content\n\nThis model is one of the longest I have trained and tuned, includes some noise training but this is not intended for deblocking/decompression. Combined with https://github.com/JoeyBallentine/Video-Inference 's fp16 mode, this should handle most SD and 720p content at or faster than ESRGAN, with a significant bump in quality.\n\nPretrained model: Self-Trained Base for the Unet finalisation with vgg_fea discrim",
