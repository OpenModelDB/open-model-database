    "description": "Category: Banding\nPurpose: Banding\n\nAttempts to remove the damages done by color banding. For this model, I downscaled all of the HR images to make their pixel size closer to 1000x1000 using the Box filter and then downscaled them again by 50% using the Point filter. Afterwards, I applied 64-bit color banding to every image in the dataset.",
