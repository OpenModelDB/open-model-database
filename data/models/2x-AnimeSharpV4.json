    "description": "Purpose: Anime\n\nThis is a successor to AnimeSharpV3 based on RCAN instead of ESRGAN. It outperforms both versions of AnimeSharpV3 in every capacity. It's sharper, retains *even more* detail, and has very few artifacts. It is __extremely faithful__ to the input image, even with heavily compressed inputs. \n\nTo use this model, you must update to the [**latest chaiNNer nightly build**](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer-nightly/releases)\n\nThe `2x-AnimeSharpV4_Fast_RCAN_PU` model is trained on RCAN PixelUnshuffle. This is much faster, but comes at the cost of quality. I believe the model is ~95% the quality of the full V4 RCAN model, but ~6x faster in Pytorch and ~4x faster in TensorRT. This model is ideal for video processing, and as such was trained to handle MPEG2 & H264 compression.\n\n__Comparisons:__ https://slow.pics/c/63Qu8HTN\nhttps://slow.pics/c/DBJPDJM9\n![1736292155 679079](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/875be696-0948-4de2-9d03-85a581891a49)",
