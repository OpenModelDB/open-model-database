    "description": "Category: Anime and Cartoons\nPurpose: Animation\n\nRestoring frames from the show \"Sheeep\"\n\nThis model was trained to restore \"Sheeep\" while retaining and enhancing the noise present in the show. The model amazingly finished training in only 8.8k iterations with no pretrain, with a dataset of only 4 image pairs. This model should work well for animes and cartoons with a lot of grain present. There are some slight haloing issues in dark colors unfortunately, but I was unable to fix it.",
