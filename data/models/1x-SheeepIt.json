The model amazingly finished training in only 8.8k iterations with no pretrain, with a dataset of only 4 image pairs. This model should work well for animes and cartoons with a lot of grain present. There are some slight haloing issues in dark colors unfortunately, but I was unable to fix it.\n\nRestoring frames from the show \"Sheeep\"",
