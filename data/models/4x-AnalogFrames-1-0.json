    "description": "Restore frames to their original look as on Drawings. Before analog transfer\n\nTrained on thousands of 4K HQ Drawing scans, the purpose of this model is restore the frame to its original paper and plastic look, with a particular emphasis on textures and preserving those brushstrokes and natural lines. Not to be used with heavily grainy sources.\nNote: The random white speckles are an unfortunate side effect of not filtering the dataset.",
