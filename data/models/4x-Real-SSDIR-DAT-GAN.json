    "description": "4x photo upscaler on the SSDIR_Sharp dataset, trained with otf, using the same settings as Real_HAT_GAN.  \nThese otf values are very high in my opinion. This was an experiment if I used the same settings as Real_HAT_GAN (therefore the name).   \nThis model will denoise very strongly and smooth out a lot (so a lot of details will be lost. But maybe this effect might be beneficial to someone)",
