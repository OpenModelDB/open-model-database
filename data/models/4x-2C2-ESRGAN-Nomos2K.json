    "description": "Technically my previous experiment was the pretrained model, but for all intents and purposes this was trained from scratch. Description: Pretrained model for the new architecture modification I made. You can read more about it in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/joeyballentine/2C2-ESRGAN). Basically it makes smaller ESRGAN models that theoretically can produce the same level of quality.\n\n**NOTE:** THIS WILL NOT WORK IN CUPSCALE or IEU! You have to use chaiNNer or my fork to use it for now.\n\nPretrained model: Technically my previous experiment was the pretrained model, but for all intents and purposes this was trained from scratch.",
