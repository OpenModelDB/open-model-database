    "description": "Category: Normal Map/Bump Map Generation\nPurpose: Map Generation - Normal Maps\n\nThis model generates \"Franken Maps\" (named after Frankenstein), which is a custom material map combination I made. Basically, the Red channel of RGB is just the texture converted to grayscale, the Green channel is the roughness map, and the Blue channel is the displacement map. I had to do this to get around the current limitation of CX loss where it requires a 3 channel output (otherwise I would have just made a 2 channel model, or separate single channel models). As of right now the channels need to be manually split from each other but I will be making a tool for doing this automatically in the coming days.",
