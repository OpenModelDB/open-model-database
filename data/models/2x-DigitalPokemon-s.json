    "description": "This model is designed to upscale the standard definition digital era of the Pokémon anime, which runs from late season 5 (Master Quest) to early season 12 (Galactic Battles). During this time, the show was animated digitally in a 4:3 ratio. This process was also used for Mewtwo Returns, most of Pokémon Chronicles, and the Mystery Dungeon specials.\n\nAdvice/Known Limitations:\n* I recommend using QTGMC on a preset of \"Slow\" or slower for deinterlacing. While the show is primarily animated at 12/24 fps, some elements like backgrounds are animated at a full 60i, particularly for the Diamond & Pearl era, which increased the base animation frame rate to 15 fps.\n* The model is not great at handling fonts, particularly the italicized text in the episode credits. This is despite including font images in the training data.\n\nVersion History:\n\n* 1.1.0 (9/16/2025): Added images from SD portion of season 12, augmented training to better handle slightly resized images.\n* 1.0.0: Initial Release",
